These emerging technologies will change the way we live, how we look after our bodies and help us avert a climate disaster.Published: July 7, 2023 at 8:30 amTechnology moves at a relentlessly fast pace in the modern world. It can sometimes feel like every single day there are new technologies and innovations that will change our futures forever. But in a steady stream of announcements about new massive futuristic technological upgrades and cool gadgets, it is easy to lose track of the amazing ways the world is progressing. For instance, there are artificial intelligence programs writing poems from scratch and making images from nothing more than a worded prompt. There are 3D-printed eyes, new holograms, lab-grown food and brain-reading robots. All of this just scratches the surface of what is out there, so we've curated a guide to the most exciting future technologies, listing them all below. Necrobotics\u00a9 Preston Innovation Laboratory/Rice University Sometimes new future technologies can offer amazing development, with the possibility of changing the future... while also being incredibly creepy. This is one way to describe the idea of necrobotics which, as the name suggests, involves turning dead things into robots. While this sounds like a plot to a creepy horror film, this is a technology being explored at Rice University. A team of researchers turned a dead spider into a robot-like gripper, given the ability to pick up other objects. To achieve this, they take a spider and inject it with air. This works because spiders use hydraulics to force their version of blood (haemolymph) into their limbs, making them extend. Right now this concept is in its infant stages, but it could mean a future where dead animals are used to further science... it all feels very Frankeinstein-like! Sand batteries\u00a9 Edwin Remsberg Not every technology bettering our future has to be complicated, some are simple, yet extremely effective. One of these kind of technologies has come from some Finnish engineers who have found a way to turn sand into a giant battery. These engineers piled 100 tons of sand into a 4 x 7 metre steel container. All of this sand was then heated up using wind and solar energy. This heat can then be distributed by a local energy company to provide warmth to buildings in nearby areas. Energy can be stored this way for long periods of time. All of this occurs through a concept known as resistive heating. This is where a material is heated by the friction of electrical currents. Sand and any other non-super conductor are warmed by the electricity passing through them generated heat than can be used for energy. E-skin could help us hug long-distance friends While modern technology allows us to communicate verbally and visually almost anywhere in the world, there is currently no reliable method of sharing the sense of touch across long distances. Now, a wireless soft e-skin developed by engineers at the City University of Hong Kong could one day make giving and receiving hugs over the internet a reality. The e-skin is studded with flexible actuators that sense the wearer\u2019s movements and convert them into electrical signals. These signals can then be sent to another e-skin system via Bluetooth, where the actuators convert them into mechanical vibrations that mimic the initial movements. The system could be used to allow friends and family to \u2018feel\u2019 each other over long distances, the researchers say. Smelly VR Researchers at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU) recently invented what they're calling a 'novel, wireless, skin-interfacedolfactory feedback system'. In other words, VR attachments that let you smell stuff. The smells are generated by the devices heating and melting odorous wax that releases adjustable concentrations of stink. There are two versions of this tech. One is 'mounted' on your upper lip for easy access to your nostrils, and the other is a facemask-like design with hundreds of different odour combinations. The university said their new tech has a broad range of applications that includes online teaching and 4D movie watching. That's right, in the future, you'll not only be able to watch your favourite movies in VR, you'll also be able to smell them. Now that's immersion! Catapulting satellites into space\u00a9 Spinlaunch Who would have thought the best way to get satellites into space was with a makeshift catapult! Okay, it is a lot smarter than a catapult but the technology exists in a similar way. SpinLaunch is a prototype system for getting satellites or other payloads up into space. It does this by using kinetic energy instead of the usual technique of using chemical fuel found in traditional rockets. This technology could be capable of spinning payloads at 8,000km/h and 10,000G, then launching them skyward through a large launch tube. Of course, small rocket engines will still be required for payloads to reach orbit, but SpinLaunch has claimed this system cuts down on the fuel and infrastructure by an impressive 70 per cent. The company has signed an agreement with NASA and is now testing the system. XenotransplantationSurgeons mid-operation \u00a9 University of Maryland School of Medicine Inserting the heart of a pig into a humanfeels like a bad idea, and yet, this is one of the latest medical procedures that is seeing rapid progress. Xenotransplantation - the procedure of transplanting, implementing or infusing a human with cells, tissues or organs from an animal source - has the potential to revolutionise surgery. One of the most common procedures performed so far is the insertion of a pig's heart into a human. This has now successfully happened twice. However, one of the patients was only alive for a few months, and the second is still being observed. In these surgeries, the heart cannot be instantly put into a human, gene-editing needs to take place first. Certain genes need to be knocked out of the heart and human genes need to be added, mainly around immune acceptance and genes to prevent excessive growth of heart tissue. Right now, these surgeries are risky and there is no certainty around success. However, in the near future, we could see xenotransplants happening on a regular basis, providing hearts or tissues from animals to humans in need of it. AI image-generationAstronaut holding a flower \u00a9 OpenAI As artificial intelligence continues to perform jobs just as well as humans, there is a new industry to add to the list \u2013 the world of art. Researchers at the company OpenAI have created a software that is able to create images from just worded prompts. Type in \u2018a dog wearing a cowboy hat singing in the rain\u2019 and you\u2019ll get a host of completely original images that fit that description. You can even choose what style of art your request will come back in. However, the technology isn't perfected and still has issues, like when we gave it poor prompts on designing cartoon characters. This technology known as Dall-E is now its second iteration and the team behind it plans to continue developing it further. In the future, we could see this technology used to create art exhibitions, for companies to get quick, original illustrations or of course, to revolutionise the way we create memes on the internet. There is also technology known as Midjourney, a AI image generator that creates gothic masterpieces with a simple text prompt. We are truly living in the future.
